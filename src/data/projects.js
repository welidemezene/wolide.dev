        title: 'üè† Interactive 3D Room Portfolio',
        description: 'An immersive 3D room portfolio built with Three.js featuring interactive objects, smooth animations, and realistic lighting. Explore a virtual room with hover effects and dynamic interactions.',
        longDescription: `A sophisticated 3D interactive portfolio room that showcases advanced Three.js development and user experience design. This project demonstrates how to create an immersive digital environment where users can explore a virtual room with interactive elements, smooth animations, and realistic lighting effects.

The room features a carefully designed interior with various interactive objects that respond to user hover and click interactions. Each object has custom animations and effects that create an engaging and dynamic user experience. The project showcases advanced techniques in 3D web development including raycasting, custom materials, and optimized rendering.

Key features include:
- Interactive 3D room environment with realistic lighting
- Hover effects and animations on room objects
- Smooth camera controls and navigation
- Custom materials and textures for realistic appearance
- Raycasting system for object interaction
- Optimized rendering for smooth performance
- Responsive design that works across devices
- Dynamic lighting and shadow systems

Technical Implementation:
- Advanced raycasting system for object interaction
- Custom hitbox generation for complex interactions
- Smooth animation system with GSAP integration
- Optimized mesh handling and rendering
- Realistic material and texture mapping
- Performance-optimized 3D scene management

Interactive Elements:
- Hover animations on room objects
- Click interactions with visual feedback
- Smooth camera movement and controls
- Dynamic lighting effects
- Responsive object animations

The project addresses complex technical challenges including:
- Raycasting precision and hitbox management
- Animation state management and performance
- Material and texture optimization
- Camera control and user experience
- Cross-browser compatibility and performance

This portfolio room serves as both a showcase of technical skills and a creative demonstration of 3D web development capabilities, providing visitors with an engaging and memorable experience.`,
